# Exploring the use of regular and ResNet CNNs in Quark and Gluon Jet Classification

### Introduction
This project explores the classification of Quark and Gluon jets in high-energy particle collision events. Specifically, a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pre-trained ResNet50 are used for classifying quark and gluon jets, using 2D histogram representations derived from Pythia8 simulations. Pythia8 is an event generator that uses random samples based on real physics to simulate what happens in a real collider.
  The goal was to evaluate the performance of these models in a binary classification task using only visual features, without incorporating high-level physical attributes like jet substructures. The dataset consists of 40,000 samples (20,000 quark and 20,000 gluon jets), transformed into normalized 64Ã—64 grayscale histograms. The CNN was carefully tuned for optimal architecture and regularization, while the ResNet50 was applied with matching parameters to allow fair comparison. Performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics. Results showed that both models achieved moderate classification performance, with the CNN slightly outperforming ResNet50. The best CNN configuration reached an accuracy of 68.2% and an AUC of 0.74, surpassing random guessing but falling short of deployment-ready reliability.
